// slug             string      A human-readable string that is used to uniquely identify each size.
// available        boolean     This is a boolean value that represents whether new Droplets can be created with this size.
// transfer         number      The amount of transfer bandwidth that is available for Droplets created in this size. This only counts traffic on the public interface. The value is given in terabytes.
// price_monthly    number      This attribute describes the monthly cost of this Droplet size if the Droplet is kept for an entire month. The value is measured in US dollars.
// price_hourly     number      This describes the price of the Droplet size as measured hourly. The value is measured in US dollars.
// memory           number      The amount of RAM allocated to Droplets created of this size. The value is represented in megabytes.
// vcpus            number      The number of virtual CPUs allocated to Droplets of this size.
// disk             number      The amount of disk space set aside for Droplets of this size. The value is represented in gigabytes.
// regions          array       An array containing the region slugs where this size is available for Droplet creates.
