// id               number              A unique number that can be used to identify and reference a specific image.
// name             string              The display name that has been given to an image. This is what is shown in the control panel and is generally a descriptive title for the image in question.
// type             string              The kind of image, describing the duration of how long the image is stored. This is one of "snapshot", "temporary" or "backup".
// distribution     string              This attribute describes the base distribution used for this image.
// slug             nullable string     A uniquely identifying string that is associated with each of the DigitalOcean-provided public images. These can be used to reference a public image as an alternative to the numeric id.
// public           boolean             This is a boolean value that indicates whether the image in question is public or not. An image that is public is available to all accounts. A non-public image is only accessible from your account.
// regions          array               This attribute is an array of the regions that the image is available in. The regions are represented by their identifying slug values.
// created_at       String
// min_disk_size    number              The minimum 'disk' required for a size to use this image.
